# PDFTron Android OCR Scanner Sample
This sample showcases the OCR capabilities of the PDFTron SDK. This sample consists of two parts: the server component which makes use of Firebase Cloud functions and Firebase Storage, and the client part which uses an [Android scanner library](https://github.com/brandenfung2/AndroidScannerDemo) to scan documents.
